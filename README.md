# Vloxy Engine
A library to create block based voxel worlds

## Goals
- Extensible Api to create any type of voxel worlds
- infinite generation
- multi threaded
- Complex Noise Generation System
- Serialization
- Physics & Fluids
- Networking

## Todo
- [ ] Debug Tools/Gizmos
- [ ] Native Containers & New Mesh API's
- [ ] AO Generation
- [ ] Jobs & Burst
- [ ] Chunk Pages & Serialization
- [ ] Runtime Modifications of voxels

## Done
- [x] Greedy Mesh Builder
- [x] Block, Chunk Base
- [x] World (Chunk World)
- [x] Build Coordinator (Multi-Threading)
- [x] Chunk Pool (infinite generation)
- [x] Provider to configure the engine
- [x] Settings scriptable objects
- [x] 3D chunks
- [x] Noise Profile System
- [x] Settings Extensions
